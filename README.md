# Typersion
## Instructions for Installation
1. Download or clone the repositoty (button at the top right of page).
2. Download *Node.js* if you don't already have it (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
3. If you're on MacOS, simply drag the `launch-game.sh` file into the terminal.  
4. If you're on windows, it'll be a little more tricky.
  * Go into your command prompt and type `npm install http-server -g`
  * Then, if you remember where you downloaded the repo, `CD` to it. 
  * If you don't remember, you can use `dir Typersion /AD /s`. This will output a dir. Just type `CD` followed by the output directory.
  * Now type `http-server` once you're in the project folder. Then navigate to the url in the prompt (most likely `http://127.0.0.1:8080`)
5. Choose either freeplay or adventure mode -> Go out.
6. Gig 'em!
